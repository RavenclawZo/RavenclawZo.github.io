My website; blog about diy.org.

Will contain articles about fun crafts, cool things, and general updates for the site.
If you are a DIYer and would like to help, please notify me and I will add you.

PS
Please note this is made basically from scratch from a not very experienced coder, so sorry about messy code, spammy commits, etc. I am working on getting better on it. Thanks
